- Django: web framework that enabled the python development of the Pokedex. We chose this Open Source framework for its simplicity and flexibility.
- HTML/CSS : to build and style the pages of the site.
- Bootstrap : free CSS and Open Source framework created by Twitter. Bootstrap is designed to operate optimally on all screen sizes of the user interface. It also provides a standardization of graphic elements such as buttons.
- Git Hub : to work in a group on the project and commits changes on branchs, it's a useful tool for the project organisation.

## Teams
